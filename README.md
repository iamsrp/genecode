# genecode

The genecode package is a genetic algorithms implementation which aims to mimic the way biological viruses behave in the real world.

It requires Java8 and ant to build but, aside from that, should not need anything special. See the JavaDoc, and the example package, for more information.

It currently works with a cut-down type system which supports various primitive Java types within a basic functional programming language.
